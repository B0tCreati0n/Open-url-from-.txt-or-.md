# URL Opener

URL Opener is a Python script that opens URLs found in a text file (.txt) or markdown file (.md) in new web browser tabs/windows.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the `url_opener.py` script.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the `url_opener.py` script is located.

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python url_opener.py
   ```
- Enter the path to a .txt or .md file containing URLs when prompted.

- If URLs are found in the file, the script will display the count of URLs and prompt for confirmation to proceed.
- If confirmed, the script will open each URL in a new web browser tab/window.
- To quit the program, enter 'q' when prompted for the file path.

## Notes:

- The URLs should be listed on separate lines within the file.
- URLs should start with either http:// or https://.
- The webbrowser module will open the URLs in your default web browser.

## Example:

- Suppose you have a file named urls.txt with the following content:

```
http://www.example.com
https://www.example.org
https://www.example.net
```
- Running the script and providing the path to urls.txt will open the three URLs in separate web browser tabs/windows.
